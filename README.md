# OptiCurriculum

This project is an automatic course planner for a department's curriculum semester, built with TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and Angular. It assigns classrooms and time slots for each course, ensuring no overlap within the same year. The planner takes into account varying classroom capacities and student registrations, scheduling courses within the available 8 time slots per weekday (8:30 to 16:30).
